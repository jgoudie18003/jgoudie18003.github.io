            <h1>Temple Inn & Suites Headquarters & Administration</h1>
            <p>The Temple Inn & Suites is a hotel chain headquartered in Bethesda, MD that builds and manages
                specialized hotel accommodations near
                temple locations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints around the world. The owner-operated
                company caters to temple
                workers, patrons, and their families by providing specialized services and accommodations that meet the
                needs of those patrons.
                The hotel accommodations and services are available to anyone willing to abide by the terms and policies
                outlined by the company.
                The overall goal of the website project is to promote and provide information about the specialized
                services that this hotel chain
                offers to meet the needs of temple patrons who come to serve in the temple or who participate in events
                such as sealings, weddings,
                receptions, and youth trips. The website should reflect the Church culture and be designed to support a
                temple oriented theme as
                well as the concept of being a haven of comfort and accessibility.
